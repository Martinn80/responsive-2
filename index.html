                    I am Martin I am 39 years old. I am married and I have a 2 year old daughter. My background is
                    mainly in trouble shooting. I was an aircraft technician for 3 years in Oakland, CA and I also
                    worked in the maritime industry for about 6 years doing everything from a deckhand, engineer, and
                    boat captain here in the SanFrancisco Bay. And I had a few jobs in between, everything from
                    construction work to custodial work. I began my coding
                    journey in 2017 the day my wife told me we were having a baby. Since 2017 I have been teaching
                    myself how to code. Of course once our daughter was born coding took a backseat to the the full time
                    job and a newborn baby, but I studied when I got the chance. Now my baby is 2 years old and there is
                    no better time than the present to take things up a notch in my coding journey and commit to a life
                    changing coding bootcamp!!

                    <br>
                    I'm excited for this class and for this opportunity. I look forward to working with my classmates
                    and building lifelong relationships.
